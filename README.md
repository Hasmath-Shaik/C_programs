# C Programming Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of basic and important C programs I have written to improve my programming skills. These programs cover fundamental concepts like control structures, arrays, strings, functions, and file handling.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
- **Basic**: Simple C programs (Hello World, Sum, Even/Odd, Prime, Factorial)
- **Control_Structures**: Programs using if-else, loops, and switch case
- **Arrays**: Programs related to array operations and sorting
- **Strings**: String manipulation programs like palindrome check, reverse string
- **Functions**: Programs using functions and recursion
- **File_Handling**: Programs for reading from and writing to files
- **Mini_Projects**: Small C-based projects like student management

## ðŸš€ Sample Programs Included
- Hello World
- Sum of Two Numbers
- Prime Number Check
- Palindrome Check
- Fibonacci Series
- Array Sorting
- File Read and Write

## ðŸ“š Purpose
- To strengthen my understanding of C programming.
- To build a beginner-friendly GitHub portfolio.
- To track my learning progress through practical coding.

## ðŸ’» How to Run
- Open the program in any C compiler (GCC, Turbo C, CodeBlocks, etc.).
- You can also use online compilers like [Programiz Online Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler).
- Compile and run the program files which are saved with `.c` extension.
